I make videos to illustrate how it works. I hope it also works on your computer.

This project is designed to support Modularity. It shows how Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) 
can accelerate the development of an electronic toothbrush by automation the reparative processes. The component is built with High Level Primitives (HLPs). Once enough initial values are given to the HLPs, the geometry can be automatically generated. Moreover, the assembly processes are also pre-defined. For example, we can select different motor from motor library and get an assembly without specify the position, direction or constraint with other component like gears. This feature let us can generate a new design of toothbrush rapidly. Finally, when we finish a design, we can test it in MATLAB. Though the communication model (a matlab package), we can output data and commands to the MATLAB and then read simulation results back.
